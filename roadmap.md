# RaceSchedules Roadmap

This roadmap is a shared guide to show where we're building next — whether you're here to use the app or help build it.

## Vision

I want RaceSchedules to become the most reliable, comprehensive, and community-driven hub for tracking motorsport events worldwide. This means moving beyond a simple list to become an intelligent, personalized calendar that ensures fans never miss a start light.

## Primary Goals

-   **Intuitive User Interface & Design:** Implement a clean, modern, and fully responsive graphical interface. This includes a visual redesign and the integration of championship/team logos to make browsing a pleasure. The goal is to make finding information effortless, whether on desktop or mobile.
-   **Customizable Notification System:** Build a core feature that allows users to "follow" championships or specific races and receive timely reminders. This system should be flexible, supporting email and potentially browser notifications, ensuring no fan misses a qualifying session or race start.
-   **Rich & Expanding Database:** The heart of the project. I will try to continuously grow the database to cover not as many series as I can. This is a massive work, and if you are willing to help, the `DATA_CONTRIBUTING.md` guide is the key.
-   **Robust Platform & Visibility:** Transition from a free-tier prototype to a stable, reliable service. This involves securing a memorable domain name, exploring more robust deployment options, and implementing proper monitoring to ensure the site is always up and fast.

## Your Contributions

This project exists and grows because of you. If you see something on this roadmap that excites you—whether you're a developer, a designer, or a motorsport enthusiast — your help is invaluable.

**How to Get Involved:**
1.  **Start with Issues:** Check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/EIC95/raceschedules/issues) page. Look for labels like `good-first-issue` or `help-wanted`.
2.  **Discuss New Ideas:** Have a feature in mind? Open a discussion or an issue first to align with the project's vision before writing code.
3.  **Submit Pull Requests (PRs):** When you're ready, submit a PR. Please ensure it focuses on a single issue or feature, includes a clear description, and references the related issue. For UI changes, screenshots or GIFs are incredibly helpful.
4.  **Be Part of the Community:** Review others' PRs kindly, help triage issues, or simply share the project with other fans. All of this drives the project forward.

## Project Heartbeat

RaceSchedules began as a personal tool to solve my own problem of missing races. The transition to a community-driven open-source project is a new and exciting challenge for me. The goal is to build this *with* the community, not just *for* it.

I'll do my best to keep this roadmap updated, manage issues, and guide the project's direction while being open to your great ideas. You can always get in touch or follow the progress here:

Let's build the definitive motorsport calendar, together.
