# RaceSchedules

This project is a web application designed to help motorsports enthusiasts track the schedules of numerous racing categories. Faced with the difficulty of staying informed and the risk of missing important events, RaceSchedules aims to simplify this task.

This project is designed to be **open source and completely free**, developed by and for the motorsports community. We invite you to keep it alive and contribute to its improvement.

## Project Structure

- `backend/`: Contains the FastAPI application, database models, API endpoints, and migration scripts.
- `frontend/`: Contains the React application, including components, pages, and API integration.

## Features

- **Championship Management:** List all available racing championships.
- **Event Management:** Schedule and detail individual events within championships.
- **Session Management:** Define specific sessions (e.g., practice, qualifying, race) for each event with timezone handling.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A responsive React application for easy navigation and viewing of schedules.

## Contributions

### General Contributions

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on our code of conduct, and the process for submitting pull requests to us.

### Data Contributions (Championships and Schedules)

The world of motorsports is vast and covers many categories. It's challenging to keep all championship and schedule data up to date. That's why we rely on the community!

If you wish to contribute data for an existing championship or add a new one, please refer to the [DATA_CONTRIBUTING.md](DATA_CONTRIBUTING.md) file. You will find a detailed guide on how to contribute, a list of currently covered championships, and those we would like to see added. Your help is invaluable in enriching the database and making RaceSchedules more comprehensive!

## Envisioned Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas for the next steps of the project, and any help is welcome:

-   **Design and User Experience:** Improve the graphical interface with the addition of team/championship logos, images, and a general visual redesign.
-   **Notification System:** Implement a customizable notification system (e.g., for favorite events) to ensure no race is ever missed again.
-   **Enriched Database:** Continue to expand the database with even more championships and motorsports categories.
-   **Deployment and Visibility:** Look into upgrading to more premium deployment plans (the current ones being free) and finding an appropriate domain name for the project.

Parfait. Pour ton README, il faut une section claire, courte et engageante pour inviter les gens à rejoindre le Discord, tout en donnant le contexte. Voici un exemple prêt à copier :
