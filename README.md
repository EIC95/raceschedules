### Data Contributions (Championships and Schedules)

The world of motorsports is vast and covers many categories. It's challenging to keep all championship and schedule data up to date. That's why we rely on the community!

If you wish to contribute data for an existing championship or add a new one, please refer to the [DATA_CONTRIBUTING.md](DATA_CONTRIBUTING.md) file. You will find a detailed guide on how to contribute, a list of currently covered championships, and those we would like to see added. Your help is invaluable in enriching the database and making RaceSchedules more comprehensive!

Please see [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) for planned features and project vision.
